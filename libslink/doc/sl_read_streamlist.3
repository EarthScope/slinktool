.SH NAME
sl_read_streamlist, sl_parse_streamlist \- add entries to a stream chain

.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include <libslink.h>
.sp
.BI "int \fBsl_read_streamlist\fP (SLCD *" slconn ", char *" streamfile ",
.BI "                        char *" defselect ");
.sp
.BI "int \fBsl_parse_streamlist\fP (SLCD *" slconn ", char *" streamlist ",
.BI "                         char *" defselect ");
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
These functions add streams to the stream chain associated with
\fIslconn\fP by reading a stream list from either a file or by parsing
a string.  In both cases \fIdefselect\fP indicates default selectors
that will be used when no other selectors for a given stream are
specified.  If \fIdefselect\fP is NULL and no selectors are specified
for a stream entry then none will be used.

\fBsl_read_streamlist\fP adds stream entries read from a file with
the following format:

.nf
--------  example stream list file -------
# Comment lines begin with a '#' or '*'
GE ISP  BH?.D
NL HGN
MN AQU  BH?  HH?
--------
.fi

When no selectors are given for a specific entry, like stream NL HGN
in the above example, then the value of \fIdefselect\fP is used.

\fBsl_parse_streamlist\fP adds stream entries parsed from a string of
the following form:

"stream1[:selectors1],stream2[:selectors2],..."

\'stream\' is in NET_STA format.

For example:

"GE_ISP:BH?.D,NL_HGN,MN_AQU:BH? HH?"

When no selectors are given for a specific entry, like stream NL HGN
in the above example, then the value of \fIdefselect\fP is used.

In fact, the above example file and example string define the same
stream list.  They would both result in the same stream chain entries
if the same \fIdefselect\fP was used.

.SH RETURN VALUES
These functions return the number of streams added to the stream
chain or -1 on error.
