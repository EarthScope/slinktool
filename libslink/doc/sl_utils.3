.SH NAME
General use utility routines:

sl_dtime \- Get the current system time as a double precision
Unix/POSIX epoch

sl_doy2md \- Convert a year and day-of-year to a month and
day-of-month

sl_strncpclean \- Copy a string while removing space characters

.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include <libslink.h>
.sp
.BI "double \fBsl_dtime\fP (void);
.sp
.BI "int \fBsl_doy2md\fP (int " year ", int " jday ", int *" month ", int *" mday ");
.sp
.BI "int \fBsl_strncpclean\fP (char *" dest ", const char *" source ", int " length ");

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBsl_dtime\fP returns the current system time as a double precision
Unix or POSIX epoch time, defined as the number of seconds since
January 1, 1970.  On a Unix/Linux platform the returned time has
microsecond precision.  On a Windows (WIN32) platform the returned
time has millisecond precision.

\fBsl_doy2md\fP converts to provided 4-digit \fIyear\fP and \fIjday\fP
(day-of-year) to a month and day-of-month and places the values in
\fImonth\fP and \fImday\fP respectively via the supplied pointers.
\fIyear\fP is expected to be in the range 1900-2100, \fIjday\fP is
expected to be in the range 1-366, \fImonth\fP will be in the range
1-12 and \fImday\fP will be in the range 1-31.

\fBsl_strncpclean\fP copies \fIlength\fP characters from \fIsource\fP
to \fIdest\fP while removing all space characters.  The result is left
justified and always null terminated.  \fIsource\fP must have at least
\fIlength\fP characters and \fIdest\fP must have enough room needed
for the non-space characters within \fIlength\fP and the null
terminator.

.SH RETURN VALUES
\fBsl_dtime\fP returns a double precision epoch time.

\fBsl_doy2md\fP returns 0 on success and -1 on error (input year or
day-of-year is out of range).

\fBsl_strncpclean\fP returns the number of characters (not including
the null terminator) copied to the destination string.
