# slinktool, the all-in-one SeedLink client.

For usage information see the [slinktool manual](doc/slinktool.md)
in the 'doc' directory.

## Building and Installation

In most environments a simple 'make' will compile the program.

SunOS/Solaris:
In order to compile under Solaris the 'src/Makefile' needs to be edited.
See the Makefile for instructions.

Windows:
A Makefile.win is included for building for using with Nmake, i.e.
'nmake -f Makefile.win'.

For further installation simply copy the resulting binary and man page
(in the 'doc' directory) to appropriate system directories.

## Archiving miniSEED

The record archiving function of slinktool invoked with the `-A`, or 
preset `-BUD` and `-SDS`, options is deprecated and may be removed in a
future release.  This program is not recommended for long-term collection
of data streams.  Instead, the dedicated program `slachive` should
be used:
